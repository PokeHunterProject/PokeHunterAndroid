Distribution channel for the PokeHunter Android apk.

PokeHunter is a live scanning map that allows you to pinpoint where pokemon around you are located. It was made to be a replacement for the broken Pokemon Go tracker.

The apk is located under https://github.com/PokeHunterProject/PokeHunterAndroid/releases, please download the latest version.

To scan, center the map on your desired location and press the scan button, results should start appearing about 10 seconds later. There is a 30 second throttle between scans.

We are open data, go to https://github.com/PokeHunterProject/openapi-doc for instructions on how to use our open data api.
